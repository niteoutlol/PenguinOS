# Penguin OS
- A *os* made in python with a shell that looks like bash
- Basically copying stuff from bash so yea
- It's bad and it's just a fun little personal project on github, cus i love open-source stuff

# File Structure
- root/src/ - All the things that make the os work
- root/main.py - The main *bootloader* (just a thing that executes the nessacerry script)
- root/users/ - The user folder where their folder enviorment is stored
- root/users/verior/home/ - The user enviorment as mentioned above
